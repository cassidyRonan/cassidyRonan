### Azure Developer @ Tata Consultancy Services 
***
Welcome to my personal github where I explore new technologies in my personal time and create sample projects to test out various ideas I have.
Many of the repo's on my profile are from my time studying Game and Software Development in college so feel free to take a look around.

My personal suggestion would be to check out Project Crescent, a game which myself and my pal Sam created in our third year of college: https://nanocroft-studios.itch.io/project-crescent
